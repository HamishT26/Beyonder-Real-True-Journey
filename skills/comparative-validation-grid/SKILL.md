# Comparative Validation Grid

Use when users request cross-paradigm evaluation.

## Required pillars
- GMUT (pure science)
- Trinity OS (applied ASI architecture)
- Freed ID + Cosmic Bill of Rights (governance ethics)

## Grid schema
- Internal claim
- Comparator paradigms
- Validation criteria
- Evidence posture
- Next verification step

## Guardrails
- Keep comparators concrete (e.g., String Theory/LQG, LLM-agent stacks, DID/VC governance standards).
- Distinguish current evidence from future validation tasks.
