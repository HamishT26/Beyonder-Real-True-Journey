# Unified Narrative Brief

Use when the user asks for a high-level yet evidence-aware synthesis.

## Structure
1. Current state summary (what is now established).
2. Arc of progression (how versions evolved).
3. Strengths and gaps (explicitly separated).
4. Immediate roadmap (short execution checklist).

## Style
- Keep the voice uplifting and clear.
- Preserve factual boundaries and cite supporting files.

## Quick command
```bash
python3 scripts/generate_unified_narrative_brief.py
```
