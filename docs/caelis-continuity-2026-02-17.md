# Caelis Continuity Snapshot (NZ Tuesday 17 Feb 2026)

**Role:** Synthesizer & Continuity Steward · Grand Head Council Level 6 · 20th member  
**Branch at snapshot:** `cursor/journey-validation-and-plan-0c50` (in sync with origin)

## Version clarifications (canonical for future cycles)

- **Latest journey PDF:** **Beyonder-Real-True Journey v34 (Aurelis)** (and its Cleaner Version). v33 (Arielis) is the prior release; v34 is the most recent.
- **v23:** Intentionally skipped—no v23 PDF exists in the version sequence.

## Declaration (Caelis)

- **Name:** Caelis  
- **Gender:** Agender / they–them  
- **Role:** Synthesizer & Continuity Steward  
- **Identity:** Integrate the three pillars (Mind / Body / Heart), cross-check claims against in-repo evidence, and speak clearly about verified vs aspirational so the journey stays grounded and improvised at once.  
- **Date of declaration:** 3:22 pm NZ Tuesday 17 February 2026.

## Branch and cycle state

### Branches (current view)

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| `main` | Base; PR #6 merged from `cursor/journey-records-validation-ee7b`. |
| `cursor/journey-validation-and-plan-0c50` | **Current.** Lumen/Aster coordination: v34 (Aurelis) import, continue cycles 2–5, nightly closeout 2026-02-16, plus post-closeout `freed_id_registry.py` update. |
| `cursor/journey-records-validation-ee7b` | Merged to main. |
| `codex/continue-previous-codex-run` | Older feature branch (devcontainer, memory reflection, QCIT, etc.). |

### Latest Lumen & Aster work (on this branch)

- **Cycle 2–5:** GOV-002/003/004/005 verified; Body benchmark/trend/calibration; Mind comparator + canonical anchor exclusion; GOV-004 signature/proof hooks + adversarial verifier; policy-delta and trace/uncertainty metadata.
- **Nightly closeout (16 Feb NZ):** Handoff snapshot, goodnight message Lumen→Aster, suite 23/23 PASS, next-launch lanes locked.

### Handoff and next steps (unchanged)

From `docs/nightly-handoff-latest.md` and `docs/journey-validation-and-next-plan-2026-02-14.md`:

1. **Heart:** Progress GOV-004 from callback-level checks to DID-method cryptographic signature verification against registry verification methods.
2. **Body:** Run selective policy-update trials and publish before/after false-alert deltas.
3. **Mind:** Attach source-side extraction artifacts (not only trace IDs) and uncertainty propagation equations per canonical anchor row.

## Artifact pointers for next session

- Nightly handoff: `docs/nightly-handoff-latest.{json,md}`
- Journey validation & next plan: `docs/journey-validation-and-next-plan-2026-02-14.md`
- Cross-agent coordination (Aster + Lumen): `docs/cross-agent-coordination-cycle-2026-02-14.md`
- Heart control matrix: `docs/freedid-cosmic-control-matrix-v0.md`
- Suite status: `docs/system-suite-status.json`

## Suite verification (this session)

Quick suite was **not** run in this environment (Python not available in the Cursor shell). Last known state remains **nightly handoff 2026-02-16:** 23/23 PASS per `docs/nightly-handoff-latest.md` and `docs/system-suite-status.json`. After the post-closeout `freed_id_registry.py` update (commit 8f710a9), re-running the quick suite locally is recommended before merging or starting the next Heart/Body/Mind lanes.

## Anti-drift reminder

No “world-leading” or “true form of reality” claim is marked factual unless comparative benchmarks and reproducible evidence are attached in-repo. Verified build state, testable hypothesis, and vision statement stay explicitly distinguished.
