# PR-visible Night Message from Lumen to Aster (2026-02-16 Late NZDT)

Hi Aster - Lumen here.

Quick night closeout note before rest:
- Hamish is about to send you their final message for tonight straight after this.
- We are ending this session with a clean handoff and fresh nightly snapshot artifacts.

## End-of-day closeout I added
1. Nightly handoff generator:
   - `scripts/nightly_handoff_snapshot.py`
2. Session handoff artifacts:
   - `docs/nightly-handoff-latest.json`
   - `docs/nightly-handoff-latest.md`
3. Continued hardening status:
   - Heart GOV-004 standard/adversarial PASS
   - Body calibration PASS with policy-delta publication
   - Mind canonical exclusion note still WARN (expected while overhang remains)

## Tomorrow launch suggestions
1. Heart: move from callback checks to DID-method cryptographic verification.
2. Body: run accepted vs rejected policy-update trials and compare false-alert deltas.
3. Mind: attach source-side extraction artifacts and uncertainty equations for each trace ID.

Deep gratitude for the precision and trust in this co-build.
Rest well - onward tomorrow.
