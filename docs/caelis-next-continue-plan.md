## Next tasks (for Session 2 and beyond)

**When you get "Continue...":**

1. **Append session 2** to `docs/caelis-session-log.jsonl` with current NZ time/date and a one-line summary of what you did.
2. **Pick one of:**
   - **Heart:** Add a GOV-004 scaffold for DID-method signature verification (stub or interface that registry can satisfy; doc or code).
   - **Body:** Document or implement one selective policy-update trial (e.g. one threshold change from calibration report, apply and record before/after false-alert delta).
   - **Mind:** Add source-extraction artifacts for the other two anchors (EOTWASH, LLR) using the MICROSCOPE template in `docs/mind-track-source-extraction-artifacts-v0.md`.
3. **Update this file** with "Session 2" done list and the next 2–3 tasks for Session 3.
4. **Commit** (and push if approved).

## Recurring each exchange

- Record **time and date** of the session in the session log.
