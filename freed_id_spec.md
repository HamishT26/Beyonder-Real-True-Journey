# Freed ID System Specification (Draft v0.1)

The **Freed ID System** seeks to provide self‑sovereign digital identities aligned with the Cosmic Bill of Rights and the Grand Mandala ethical framework.  It builds on the [W3C Decentralised Identifier (DID) Core specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) to ensure global interoperability while adding layers of rights‑preserving governance.

## 1. Core Principles

1. **Self‑sovereignty** – Each identity holder controls their own identifier and associated credentials.  No central authority can unilaterally revoke or modify a Freed ID.
2. **Decentralisation** – Identifiers and credentials are stored on distributed ledgers or peer‑to‑peer networks; the controller can prove control without permission from any other party【626076200005617†L59-L68】.
3. **Transparency & auditability** – All transactions (issuance, revocation, updates) are logged on an append‑only ledger.  Logs are visible to the identity holder and authorised auditors.
4. **Privacy by design** – Personal data remains under the user’s control; only verifiable claims are disclosed, using selective disclosure and zero‑knowledge proofs where possible.
5. **Alignment with the Cosmic Bill of Rights** – The system enforces rights such as autonomy, dignity, equality and fairness at the protocol level.  For example, no identity holder can be coerced into sharing more data than necessary.

## 2. Data Model

A Freed ID consists of:

- **DID identifier** – A URI in the `did:freed` method namespace (e.g. `did:freed:example:1234abcdef`).  Each DID resolves to a **DID Document** containing public keys and service endpoints【626076200005617†L69-L75】.
- **Controller** – The entity (person, organisation, AI agent) that exercises control over the DID.  Controllers maintain private keys that correspond to public keys in the DID Document.
- **Service endpoints** – URLs or URNs describing services associated with the DID (e.g. credential registry, profile storage).
- **Verifiable credentials** – Digital attestations about the subject (e.g. citizenship, age, certifications), signed by trusted issuers.

## 3. DID Method: `freed`

A **DID method** specifies how identifiers of a given type are created, resolved, updated and deactivated.  The `freed` method operates as follows:

1. **Creation** – A new DID is generated by the controller using a keypair (e.g. Ed25519).  The controller submits a creation transaction to the Freed ID ledger containing the DID Document with its public keys and service endpoints.
2. **Resolution** – Resolving a `did:freed` identifier queries the ledger and returns the associated DID Document.  Clients verify that the ledger proof matches the DID.
3. **Update** – To add or rotate keys or update service endpoints, the controller signs an update message and submits it to the ledger.  The update is appended to the DID’s history.
4. **Deactivation** – The controller can deactivate its own DID by signing a deactivation request.  Deactivated DIDs remain resolvable but are marked as inactive.

## 4. Credential Issuance and Verification

1. **Issuance** – Trusted issuers (e.g. governments, universities, AI ethics boards) sign verifiable credentials and deliver them to the subject’s credential registry service endpoint.
2. **Presentation** – When the subject needs to prove a claim, they present selected credentials to a verifier.  Presentations may use selective disclosure and zero‑knowledge proofs to reveal only necessary attributes.
3. **Verification** – Verifiers check the issuer’s signature against the issuer’s DID Document and ensure the credential has not been revoked.
4. **Revocation** – Issuers can revoke a credential by publishing a revocation entry in a publicly accessible revocation registry.  Holders and verifiers consult this registry during verification.

## 5. Governance and Rights Enforcement

- **Rights ledger** – Each transaction includes metadata referencing applicable rights from the Cosmic Bill of Rights.  Smart contracts enforce these rights by preventing actions that would violate them (e.g. mass surveillance without consent).
- **Dispute resolution** – A multi‑stakeholder council mediates disputes (e.g. contested revocations, identity theft) according to transparent rules.
- **Ethics audits** – Periodic audits ensure that issuers and verifiers adhere to agreed ethical guidelines.  Violators may have their issuance privileges suspended.

## 6. Interoperability

The Freed ID system is compatible with the W3C DID Core specification and Verifiable Credentials Data Model.  This means Freed ID identities and credentials can interoperate with other self‑sovereign identity ecosystems, while retaining the additional ethical protections defined here.

This draft aims to capture the essence of the Freed ID system as described in the Beyonder‑Real‑True Journey documents and align it with established standards for decentralised identity.  It should evolve through collaboration and further research.
